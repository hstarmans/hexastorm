Test Patterns
=============
Patterns can be generated via
```console
uv run python -m hexastorm.interpolator.patterns.create
```
In the past, VTK was used to create slices.  
An alternative might be to use [PySLM](https://github.com/drlukeparry/pyslm), [Trimesh](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh) or [PyClipper](https://pypi.org/project/pyclipper/).
