star configuration  
stator should consist out of four or eight magnets;  
 result comes from https://things-in-motion.blogspot.com/2019/01/selecting-best-pole-and-slot.html  
 click on document, exclude q>0.5 and q<0.25 and slots is poles
 two options; 4 pole or 8 pole
 8 pole has higher torque but is able to achiever lower RPM  
carl uses custom angular magnets most likely ordered via aliexpress  
3 hall sensors guarantee that you lead at 90 degrees, don't think carl uses this  
duty cycle --> hard switching
six step commutation --> N N X S S X, each phase goes through this cycle

  
order new magnets  
don't fixate to prism --> carl also uses ordinary glue
