""" raspberry pi test script

test script to run on the raspberry pi

There are problems with SPI. The select pin does not work as expected.
This is most likely due to spidev library. I remapped the cs pin:
dtoverlay=spi0-1cs,cs0_pin=18
Furthermore, xfer "silently" removes items from a list.
You should make a deepcopy
